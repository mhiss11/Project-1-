# Project Description

This is a travel day planner.  You choose your destination, choose your dates, input events and reservation info pertaining to their day.  This information will then be stored and displayed for the user so they can just glance at it and know what is on the agenda for the day.  

This way you will not overlap your plans and can plan and pack for the day weatherwise. All in one easy location.
